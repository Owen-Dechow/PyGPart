# 2.2 Transforms

***Previous [2.1 Getting Started](/docs/2.1_Getting_Started.md)***

OK so we have a window that has some particles, but it's still not very interesting. Let's make things interesting.

Start by creating a new constant `TRANSFORM_POLICY` that is an instance of `TransformPolicy` that we imported in [2.1](/docs/2.1_Getting_Started.md). 
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    TRANSFORM_POLICY = TransformPolicy(
    
    )

    ...
```

Inside the initializer, we can add each of the policies that we want.

Note: **The policies will apply in the order they appear in the initializer**
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    TRANSFORM_POLICY = TransformPolicy(
        transforms.StretchY,
        transforms.PointDelta,
    )

    ...
```

Finally in the `create_particle` function, add in the transform policy to the particle initialization.
```python
Particle(
    POSITION,
    VELOCITY,
    image,
    group,
    transform_policy=TRANSFORM_POLICY # NEW LINE
) 
```

Let's run this once again and see the results.
