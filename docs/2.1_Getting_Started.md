# 2.1 Getting Started

In this tutorial we will set up a simple particle animation on a blank window. In the following sections we will discuss how to customize the system.

Ok, at this point I'm going to assume you have `PyGPart` and `Pygame` installed. (They're kinda the thing we're talking about.)

Let's start by importing the important bits.

```python
from PyGPart import Particle, Transform, TransformPolicy
import pygame as pg
import random
```

Ok now that we've done that let's get a window up and running.
```python
def render_text(surface, text_lines, font):
    for idx, text_line in enumerate(text_lines):
        text = font.render(text_line, True, (255, 255, 255), (0, 0, 0))
        surface.blit(text, (25, (idx + 1) * 25))
     
def animation():
    pg.init()
    window = pg.display.set_mode((800, 800))
    clock = pg.time.Clock()
    font = pg.font.Font(None, 32)

    while True:
        clock.tick()
        pg.display.update()
        window.fill((0, 0, 0))

        render_text(
            window,
            [
                f"FPS: {clock.get_fps()}",
            ],
            font
        )

        for event in pg.event.get():
            if event.type == pg.QUIT:
                pg.quit()
                break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    animation()
```

Ok, so if you've mastered the art of copy and pasting you should see somthing like this.

Now that we've got out window let's put some particles in it. Let's create two new functions.

```python
def create_particle(group, image):
    POSITION = pg.Vector2(400, 400)
    VELOCITY = pg.Vector2(
        (random.random() * 2 - 1) * 200,
        (random.random() * 2 - 1) * 200,
    )

    Particle(
        POSITION,
        VELOCITY,
        image,
        group,
    )

def update_particles(group, dt):
    for particle in group:
        X_GRAVITY = 0
        Y_GRAVITY = 600
        particle.step(X_GRAVITY, Y_GRAVITY, dt)
```

Now we also need to get a group, an image, and dt; call our functions; and render our particles. We can do this in our animation function.

```python
def animation():
    ...

    group = pg.sprite.Group()
    image = pg.Surface((20, 20), pg.SRCALPHA).convert_alpha()
    pg.draw.rect(
        image,
        (255, 255, 255),
        pg.Rect(2, 2, 16, 16),
    )

    while True:
        try:
            dt = 1 / clock.get_fps()
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            dt = 1

        update_particles(group, dt)
        create_particle(group, image)
        group.draw(window)

        ...
```

Note this will create a particle every single frame.

At last we can run this. Our window should look similar to this.
